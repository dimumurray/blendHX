#BrashHX
####A Unity-esque game creation system.
Fork of [mehdadoo]'s [blendHX].

####Based on 
- [Blender] 
- [Richard Lord]'s [Ash Framework] 
- and built using [Haxe]/[OpenFl].


The intent is to substitute the Unity-based Entity/Component architecture of [blendHX] with the [haxe port] of [Richard Lord]'s [Ash framework]. 

Hence: 
"Blender" + "Ash" + "Haxe" = "BrashHX"

Like its progenitor this project is highly experimental at the moment.

***
####Features planned
* Ash Framework integration
* TBD

####License
